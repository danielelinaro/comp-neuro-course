This course will provide students with an understanding of fundamental concepts of Computational Neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field studying how brains process and store information. The students will be introduced to the tools of dynamical systems theory employed throughout the course, and will learn the concept of neuron model and its relationship to neurophysiology. The course will follow a "reductionist" approach, from detailed single-compartment neuron models of the Hodgkin-Huxley family, to simplified integrate-and-fire models, and finally to rate models of interacting neuronal populations. The course will teach the student the most appropriate level of description for understanding a given neurophysiological phenomenon.
